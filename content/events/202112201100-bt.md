We completed reading Gurdjieff's main Fourth Way book All and Everything.
So we are spending the remaining weeks on presenting music principles for Fourth Way students. 
This week is the final (part 3) session of these music presentations, and is also the last session for this year.
We resume January 10, 2022.

For Swedenborg students who are unfamiliar with the Fourth Way, we recommend preparing by familiarising yourself with Gurdjieff's Fourth Way teachings by reading the book "AIM" by Peter Rhodes, free online [here](http://www.swedenborgstudy.com/books/P.Rhodes_AIM/index.html)

For those wanting to attend this third session in the series of musical principals, we strongly recommend familiarising yourself with the preliminary material from the previous two weeks, which can be viewed or downloaded [here[(https://www.dropbox.com/sh/tvb7ki38zw5dcio/AADbgSesWbo6ezfOk3wZut46a?dl=0)
