Online SAA meeting in Melbourne: -

Subject: The Modern Spiritual Encounter of East and West

Speaker: Dr Harry Oldmeadow, former Coordinator of Philosophy and Religious Studies at La Trobe University in Bendigo, now retired, author of several books.

Synopsis: Over the past two centuries the spiritual and religious contact of East and West has broadened and intensified. What kinds of challenges does modernity (and its accompanying worldview) pose for traditions of both East and West? What are some of the effects of the East-West encounter? What is religious fundamentalism, pluralism and universalism?
