At 1pm, Wednesday, 24th August, Joe Vandermeer will give a talk about Swedenborg and Divine Providence - dealing with negative influences at:

Blavatsky Lodge of the Theosophical Society
Suite 8, 599 Pacific Highway, St. Leonards NSW 2065 (entrance via Albany Street)
Enquiries (Blavatsky Lodge): Tel 02 9267 6955, or [https://sydney.theosophicalsociety.org.au](https://sydney.theosophicalsociety.org.au/)

Emanuel Swedenborg listed a number of laws and means by which Divine Providence interacts with us and the created world. Much can be learned by understanding these principles and laws, and we will study some of their implications on daily life in the present world. You may leave with a new view of ways to restore mental health and inner peace.
