Michael J Wright passed away peacefully at Neringah palliative care hospice on Tuesday 22 March 2022. 

He was known as a friend to many. Among other things he was an artist, event promoter, tour guide, painter of houses, student of Dr Philip W Groves and of Swedenborg.

We celebrate his bright and colourful life on Monday, 4th April 2022, from 10am at a service which will be streamed live here on Zoom from the Roseville New Church in Sydney. This should help the wide geographical spread of his circle of friend view and attend this service. You are welcome to leave comments in the Zoom chat but please mute yourselves throughout the service out of respect for all others online.
