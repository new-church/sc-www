At 6:30pm tonight (and on the first Monday of each month) we will be screening a free monthly Spiritual Movie at the Roseville New Church (4 Shirley Road, Roseville NSW).

Tonight's movie is "Things Heard and Seen," a 2021 film written by Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini, based on the novel All Things Cease to Appear by Elizabeth Brundage. This is a haunting tale of hidden truths, where unseen spiritual forces guide conscience, reveal inner realities, and expose the eternal consequences of our choices.

Join us Popcorn, Jaffas, and Maltesers (sorry, the dentist said Fantales have been discontinued).
The movies will be titles based on a spiritual theme or by film-makers who were influenced by Emanuel Swedenborg's writings.
Such movies may include (but are not limited to) as Ingmar Bergman movies, "What Dreams May Come," "As It Is In Heaven," and many more such titles.

Look forward to seeing you at these Roseville New Church first Monday of the month movie nights.
