This talk will focus on the history of the followers of Swedenborg in India with an emphasis on the life of D. Gopaul Chetty and his book on Swedenborg and the South Indian tradition known as Saiva Siddhanta. We will look at how Swedenborgian philosophy is a uniquely useful paradigm for engaging in inter-religious dialogue, a quality which has granted the Swedenborg tradition its unique pluralism.

Presenter Eleanor Schnarr is an artist, researcher and mystic currently living and working in Somerville MA. She has a Master of Fine Arts from the San Francisco Art Institute, and is working towards her MA from the Graduate Theological Union where she is studying the interaction between Swedenborgianism and Yoga philosophy.
