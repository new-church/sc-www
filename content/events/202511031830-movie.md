At 6:30pm tonight (and on the first Monday of each month) we will be screening a free monthly Spiritual Movie at the Roseville New Church (4 Shirley Road, Roseville NSW).

Tonight's movie will be a title based on a spiritual theme or by film-makers who were influenced by Emanuel Swedenborg's writings.
Such movies include Ingmar Bergman movies, "What Dreams May Come," "As It Is In Heaven," and similar titles.

Join us Popcorn, Jaffas, and Maltesers (sorry, the dentist said Fantales have been discontinued).

Look forward to seeing you at these Roseville New Church first Monday of the month movie nights.
