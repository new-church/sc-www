We have the pleasure of a visit from Dell J. Rose from the HHP Centre at the University of Amsterdam where he is studying for his doctorate.
Dell was also recently appointed as Program Director for the Swedenborg Library in Chicago.
His special interest is seeing how the power of Swedenborg's ideas influences social change and politics.

In this talk we will hear of some ways in which Swedenborg's work shaped Australian politics, with a focus on our second Prime Minister, Alfred Deakin. For example, in his spare time between sittings in parliament he wrote a paper entitled "The Gospel According to Swedenborg."

Dell's talk is entitled: "Australia and the New Jerusalem: Spiritual Vision & Swedenborgian Politics"
