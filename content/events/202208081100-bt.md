Read, explore and discuss Gurdjieff's allegorical tale "All and Everything" with us. It is packed with Fourth Way spiritual instruction.

For Swedenborg students not familiar with the Fourth Way at all, we recommend you take a look at the book "AIM" by Peter Rhodes, free online [here](http://www.swedenborgstudy.com/books/P.Rhodes_AIM/index.html)
