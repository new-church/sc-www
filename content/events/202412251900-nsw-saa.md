Due to technical difficulties which were beyond our control (arising just before the meeting on 18th December), it was decided to adjourn that meeting for exactly one week according to the exact 7 day adjournment period defined in the constitution.

Therefore, this SAA Special General Meeting will now be held at 7pm on Wednesday 25th December 2024. You can attend via Zoom or vote by proxy.

The special resolution to be voted upon at this Special General Meeting is the motion: "that the objects of the association as stated in the 1992 Memorandum of Incorporation be added with a not-for-profit clause to its current constitution document." We require 75% of the votes from those present (including proxies) to be in favour of this change for this special resolution to be accepted and implemented.

In a nutshell, a change is required to transfer the objects (mission statements) of the SAA from its original Memorandum of Incorporation (1992) to its current constitution. This will then allow the SAA to apply for ACNC charity status which reduces its statutory reporting requiments, its tax advantages, and set it up for healthy future functioning in line with its existing objectives.
