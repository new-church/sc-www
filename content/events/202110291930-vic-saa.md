Online SAA meeting in Melbourne: -

Subject: the Heaven and Hell project

Speaker: Rev. David Moffat .

Rev. David Moffat began a project earlier in 2021 to read Emanuel Swedenborg's most well-known publication, Heaven, and its wonders, and Hell, making audio and video recordings of each chapter. Currently, David is approximately halfway through the project. At the same time, Rohan Pereira has been assisting by preparing notes on the text to draw out the essential thrust in each chapter. Likewise, David has been recording these Notes.

David will introduce and explain this project at the meeting including presenting sections from what has been accomplished to date. We invite you to join this session and contribute your thoughts and impressions on the project.
