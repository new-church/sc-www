While Joe is on annual leave, all regular events except Howard's fortnightly bible studies will be paused. The normal events schedule will resume on Tuesday 18th April.

During this time, the Swedenborg Centre will only be open by appointment - to book, please leave a voice message on (02) 9416 2812 and wait for a confirmation reply call.

Note that Howard will only run the bible study events live, not on Zoom.

Also wishing you all a pleasant and meaningful Easter.
