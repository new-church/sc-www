At 6:30pm tonight (and on the first Monday of each month) we will be screening a free spiritual movie at the Roseville New Church (4 Shirley Road, Roseville NSW).

Tonight's movie is "As It Is In Heaven" by film-maker Kay Pollak (2006). This is a powerful story of inner awakening and transformation through music, love, and community. It shows how healing begins when we face our pain, open our hearts, and find harmony with others, revealing the divine in everyday life.

Join us Popcorn, Jaffas, and Maltesers (sorry, the dentist said Fantales have been discontinued).
The movies will be titles based on a spiritual theme or by film-makers who were influenced by Emanuel Swedenborg's writings.
Such movies will include - for example - Ingmar Bergman movies, "What Dreams May Come," "As It Is In Heaven," and many more such titles.

Look forward to seeing you at these Roseville New Church first Monday of the month movie nights.
