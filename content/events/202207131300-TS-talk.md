At 1pm, Wednesday, 13th July, Joe Vandermeer will give a talk about some sacred Islamic architecture at:

Blavatsky Lodge of the Theosophical Society
Suite 8, 599 Pacific Highway, St. Leonards NSW 2065 (entrance via Albany Street)
Enquiries (Blavatsky Lodge): Tel 02 9267 6955, or [https://sydney.theosophicalsociety.org.au](https://sydney.theosophicalsociety.org.au/)

We will examine what function of some architecture as a carrier of what is sacred, and we will look at some of the contrinuting elements.How does architecture affect us? What can it teach us? As our primary example, we will examine a building erected at the height of esoteric Islamic influence on Indian culture, the Taj Mahal, but will also examine additional structures containing various Sufi teachings. We will also look at some Fourth Way teachings by G I Gurdjieff about sacred architecture. There will be plenty of colourful slides to illustrate the material.
