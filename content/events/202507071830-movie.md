At 6:30pm tonight (and on the first Monday of each month) we will be screening a free monthly Spiritual Movie at the Roseville New Church (4 Shirley Road, Roseville NSW).

Tonight's movie is "What Dreams May Come," a 1998 fantasy drama film directed by Vincent Ward and adapted by Ronald Bass from the 1978 novel by Richard Matheson, and stars Robin Williams and Cuba Gooding Jr. This is a visually rich, emotionally stirring journey through the afterlife, where love shapes reality and the soul's inner state creates heaven or hell. A powerful story of choice, redemption, and the enduring bonds that transcend death.

Join us Popcorn, Jaffas, and Maltesers (sorry, the dentist said Fantales have been discontinued).
The movies will be titles based on a spiritual theme or by film-makers who were influenced by Emanuel Swedenborg's writings.
Such movies may include (but are not limited to) as Ingmar Bergman movies, "What Dreams May Come," "As It Is In Heaven," and many more such titles.

Look forward to seeing you at these Roseville New Church first Monday of the month movie nights.
