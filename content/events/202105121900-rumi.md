This is a pilot of a new event, over three weeks, reading the spiritual work of the famous 13th century Persian poet Rumi.

After this pilot, continuing it will depend on level of further interest.

Rumi's work is packed with spiritual instructions which resonate well with the works of Emanuel Swedenborg.

Sessions will be led by Tania Astans who will read it in Persian and in English, and will lead us in our exploration.
