Dr Maurice Nicoll was a friend and close colleague of Carl Jung and was earmarked to eventually take over to lead the psychology profession after Jung. But this never eventuated, because Nicoll met a Mr P D Ouspensky and through him met George Gurdjieff who was introducing a spiritual teaching now known as the Fourth Way to the west. Nicoll was already very insightful in the area of work with dreams, and his insights only deeped through his familiarity with the writings of Swedenborg, especially when he gravitated more and more towards those writings and the Bible in his maturing years of teachings groups in Scotland.

Maurice Nicoll gave up a lucrative Harley Street Psychology practice to study the Gurdjieff work, which was a brave yet profitable step for him. Nicoll later understood the psychology of the Fourth Way teachings very well, and documented his insights for his students in the "Psychological Commentaries on the teaching of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky."

In these reading sessions we will be exploring the "Commentaries..." material, helped at times by Swedenborg's writings and the Fourth Way teachings.
