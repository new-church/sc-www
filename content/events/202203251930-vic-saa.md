Subject: Overcoming Divisiveness

As long as there have been groups of people, there have been divisions between them - personal, racial, religious, ethnic and more. These ideological divisions in society have been the subject of a lot of discussion in the past few years, and at times the divide between the various camps seems insurmountable.
Troubling as these broader divides in society are, conflicts within our own lives are a particular source of pain and anxiety. Both need a spiritually focussed approach in order to create a lasting harmony.

Speaker: Rev. David Moffat, Spiritual Leader of the wider Swedenborg community in Victoria, will introduce issues underlying this topic and draw on the spiritual writings of Emanuel Swedenborg. The purpose of these passages is to show how the concepts provided can be directly and meaningfully applied to daily life and relationships.

There will be time provided for discussion.
A $5 donation is invited to help cover costs including light refreshments.

Venue address: 3, 20 Duerdin Street, Clayton, Vic 3168 (Parking bays in front of Units 2 & 3 and opposite)
