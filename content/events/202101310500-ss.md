As part of celebrating Swedenborg birthday, there will be a live broadcast of a free online talk from Swedenborg House in London from Gary Lachman presenting his new book Introducting Swedenborg Correspondences. Correspondences was a subject which very much influenced Blake, Baudelaire, Borges, not to mention Corbin, Coleridge, Yeats, and a host of other folk.
