Due to completing the reading of Gurdjieff's main Fourth Way book All and Everything, we are spending two weeks to present music principles for Fourth Way students. This week is part 2 of 2 and is the final session for the year (we resume January 10, 2022).

For Swedenborg students who are unfamiliar with the Fourth Way, we recommend preparing by familiarising yourself with Gurdjieff's Fourth Way teachings by reading the book "AIM" by Peter Rhodes, free online [here](http://www.swedenborgstudy.com/books/P.Rhodes_AIM/index.html)
