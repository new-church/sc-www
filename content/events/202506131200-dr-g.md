Dr Philip W Groves taught us Swedenborg principles and integrated it with science and Fourth Way teachings from Gurdjieff, as well as Sufism and practices from psychology and other streams of esoteric Christianity. He taught for over 50 years until his death in Sydney in 1999. We explore chapters from his books and lectures.
