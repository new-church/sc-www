The Roseville New Church is holding a 2-day mini retreat gathering at Roseville for anyone interested to attend in order to explore the question "What's the Use?" in relation to traditional expressions of faith, which seem to be waning in our rapidly changing culture, and the church communities experiencing these shifts. It's also a deeply personal question as we question the purpose or significance of our thoughts, intentions, or actions. What value do they bring? What impact do they have? Some of us may even question our own use in this world.

The below presentations will be held all live in the sanctuary of the Roseville New Church; 2b Shirley Avenue, Roseville NSW 2069 on Saturday 20th January. We hope you will also join us for Holy Supper worship on Sunday at 10am as well as a wrap up conversation following the service.

These meetings are an opportunity to delve a little deeper into any of the concepts expressed in Swedenborg writing and to relate it to facets of our own lives.

Saturday's schedule kicks off with opening worship at 9:00 (coffee available from 8:30). We will have two sessions in the morning, followed by lunch. The afternoon will have two more sessions and all should be concluded around 4:30pm. Both morning and afternoon sessions will be separated by coffee/tea breaks.

All expenses for the event are being covered by the Roseville New Church.
The sessions will be recorded and available for viewing later.
If you would be interested in attending remotely please contact me (revhathompson@gmail.com) and indicate so. He will forward a link, assuming we can over-come our technological hurdles before Friday.

If you plan on attending or have questions, please contact Howard at the email address below.
