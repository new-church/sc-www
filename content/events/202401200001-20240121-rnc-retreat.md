The Roseville New Church is holding a 2-day gathering (a mini retreat) at the New Church, 4 Shirley Road, Roseville NSW, for anyone who want to explore the question "What's the Use?" in relation to traditional expressions of faith, which seem to be waning in our rapidly changing culture, and the church communities experiencing these shifts. It's also a deeply personal question as we question the purpose or significance of our thoughts, intentions, or actions. What value do they bring? What impact do they have? Some of us may even question our own use in this world.

Live presentations will be held on Saturday 20th January, and a worship and wrap-up discussion will take place on Sunday 21st January, all live at Roseville.
