Read, explore and discuss Gurdjieff's allegorical tale "All and Everything", which is packed with spiritual instruction.

For Swedenborg students not familiar with the Fourth Way at all, we recommend you take a look at the book "AIM" by Peter Rhodes, free online [here](http://www.swedenborgstudy.com/books/P.Rhodes_AIM/index.html)
