The Swedenborg Centre is presently closed for Christmas and New Year. 

Our first day back will be Thursday, January 6th, ready to start the online annual retreat that day (see events).

There will be no events on during the break.

More events for later 2022 events will be added to the website over this holiday break.

We have been delighted with your generous support over this difficult year, and hope you will continue to participate in - and benefit from - what we offer.

We wish you each a most wonderful and meaningful sacred season.

See you in the new year.

Thanks and greetings from the Swedenborg Centre staff, Liz Kemmis and Joe Vandermeer.
