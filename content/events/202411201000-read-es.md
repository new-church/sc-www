In these Zoom sessions we read slowly through one of the works of Swedenborg and reflect on what we are reading. There is room to explore the ideas expressed in the writings by way of informal discussion between reading of the paragraphs. The reading material is shared on the screen. This can be a very rewarding way to help understand Swedenborg's main concepts.
