During Joe's attendance at the New Church in Australia's Council Of Ministers (COM) meeting and then travelling overseas, ONLINE events will be paused from Saturday, July 26th until normal events resume again starting Monday, September 8th. The Swedenborg Centre will be closed during this period of absence.

NOTE: the LIVE monthly Spiritual Movie nights at the Roseville New Church (6:30pm first Monday of each month) will continue to be held even while the Swedenborg Centre is closed during the above period. Come and enjoy these excellent free movies!

Apologies for any inconvenience and adverse consequences. Looking forward to seeing you participate again from September 8th onwards.
