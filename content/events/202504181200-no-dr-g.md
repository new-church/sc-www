Due to two weeks of public holidays (first is the Good Friday Easter holiday, and the week after is the Anzac Day public holiday), there will be no Dr Philip Groves reading group on these two consecutive Fridays.

We will resume as normal again the week after (Friday, 2nd May) at the usual Sydney time.
