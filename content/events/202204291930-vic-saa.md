Zoom presentation by Rev David Millar on "The Nature of the Self: You might just not be who you think you are"

The question of 'Who am I, really?' has seen many attempts to answer it by many philosophers, schools, religions and individuals. Swedenborg gives us clear picture of how to think about this question, which has the power to inform our whole relationship to life, others, the world around us and to higher life and God.

Rev David Millar is Principal Director of the Australian New Church College and runs the highly valued Logopraxis self-study groups.
