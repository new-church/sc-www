At 6:30pm tonight (and on the first Monday of each month) we will be screening a free monthly Spiritual Movie at the Roseville New Church (4 Shirley Road, Roseville NSW).

Tonight's movie is "The Seventh Seal" by Swedish film-maker Ingmar Bergman (1957). This film is a stark, meditative journey through doubt, death, and the soul’s yearning for truth. Its imagery and dialogue evoke the inner struggle between despair and awakening, offering a profound reflection on life’s spiritual meaning.

Join us Popcorn, Jaffas, and Maltesers (sorry, the dentist said Fantales have been discontinued).
The movies will be titles based on a spiritual theme or by film-makers who were influenced by Emanuel Swedenborg's writings.
Such movies may include (but are not limited to) as Ingmar Bergman movies, "What Dreams May Come," "As It Is In Heaven," and many more such titles.

Look forward to seeing you at these Roseville New Church first Monday of the month movie nights.
