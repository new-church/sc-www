Melbourne SAA meeting live at 7:30pm on Friday, 26 March, 2021 will be held at Unit 3 / 20 Duerdin Street, Clayton VIC 3168.

Although not absolutely necessary, it would be helpful to let Neville know (details below) if you're planning to come along.

This meeting will begin by watching a 30 minute documentary produced by The Swedenborg Society (London) in 2010, entitled "Heaven, Hell and Other Places", which presents the many facets of Swedenborg's life, experiences and teachings through the eyes and minds of well-accredited philosophers, writers and historians including Lars Bergquist (Swedish) and Gary Lachman (USA) along with Swedenborgian scholars.

Much of the information is reasonably well-known, yet it is offered in a challenging way.  It opens up a number of areas for interesting discussion.  The film ends up with a brief look at conditions required for true happiness and love.  Time permitting, we can take this further through discussion, including several quotations from Swedenborg's spiritual writings.

Neville Jarvis.
