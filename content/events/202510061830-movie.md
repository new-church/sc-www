At 6:30pm tonight (and on the first Monday of each month) we will be screening a free monthly Spiritual Movie at the Roseville New Church (4 Shirley Road, Roseville NSW). 

So join us Popcorn, Jaffas, and Maltesers (sorry, the dentist said Fantales have been discontinued).
The movie will be a title based on a spiritual theme or by film-makers who were influenced by Emanuel Swedenborg's writings.
Such movies may include (but are not limited to) as Ingmar Bergman movies, "What Dreams May Come," "As It Is In Heaven," and many more such titles.

Look forward to seeing you at these Roseville New Church first Monday of the month movie nights.
