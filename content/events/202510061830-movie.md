At 6:30pm tonight (and on the first Monday of each month) we will be screening a free spiritual movie at the Roseville New Church (4 Shirley Road, Roseville NSW).

Tonight's movie is called "Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring," a 2003 spiritual movie by famous Korean director Kim Ki-duk. This award-winning film is about the cycles of life and spiritual evolution, and explores nature as a correspondence of the soul's growth.

Join us Popcorn, Jaffas, and Maltesers (sorry, the dentist said Fantales have been discontinued).

Look forward to seeing you at these Roseville New Church first Monday of the month movie nights.

These movies are screened for free publically under our BSML screening licence.
