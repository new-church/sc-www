Dr Philip W Groves taught Swedenborg and integrated it with science, with Fourth Way teachings from Gurdjieff, with Sufism and material and practices from psychology and other streams of esoteric Christianity. He taught for over 50 years until his death in Sydney in 1999. Here we explore chapters from his books.
