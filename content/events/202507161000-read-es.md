In these Zoom sessions we read slowly through one of the works of Swedenborg or something closely related, and reflect on what we are reading. There is ample room to explore the ideas by way of informal discussion between reading the paragraphs. The reading material is shared on the screen. These sessions are a very rewarding way to help understand Swedenborg's main concepts and how these relate to our lives.

To see what the current topic is, refer to the 'topics' news item on the home page.
