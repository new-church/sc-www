The Swedenborg Centre is closed between Christmas and New Year, starting Saturday December 24th. 

Our first day back will be Wednesday, January 4th.

There will be no events on during the break.

More events for later in 2023 events keep your eye on the events column and page.

We have been delighted with your generous support in the past year, and hope you will continue to participate in - and benefit from - what we offer.

We wish you each a most wonderful and meaningful sacred season.

See you in the new year.

Thanks and greetings from the Swedenborg Centre staff, Liz Kemmis and Joe Vandermeer.
