Note that due to the SAA AGM on the same day, there will ONLY be a noon session (i.e. NO 7pm session).

Dr Philip W Groves taught us Swedenborg principles and integrated it with science and Fourth Way teachings from Gurdjieff, as well as Sufism and practices from psychology and other streams of esoteric Christianity. He taught for over 50 years until his death in Sydney in 1999. We explore chapters from his books and lectures.
