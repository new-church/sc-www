The Swedenborg Centre is closed between Christmas and New Year, starting Saturday December 23rd. 

Our first day back will be Monday, January 8th.

There will be no events on during the break.

We have been delighted with your generous support in the past year, and hope you will continue to participate in - and benefit from - what we offer.

We wish you each a most wonderful and meaningful sacred season.

See you in the new year.

Thanks, and greetings from the Swedenborg Centre staff, Liz Kemmis and Joe Vandermeer.
