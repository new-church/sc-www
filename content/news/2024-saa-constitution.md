For the proposed SAA constitution (changes in yellow highlight) [click here](https://static.swedenborg.com.au/pdf/newconstitution.pdf)

In a nutshell, a change is required to transfer the objects (mission statements) of the SAA from its original Memorandum of Incorporation (1992) to its current constitution. This will then allow the SAA to apply for ACNC charity status which reduces its statutory reporting requiments, its tax advantages, and set it up for healthy future functioning in line with its existing objectives.
