The [New Church In Australia (NCIA)](http://newchurch.net.au/) holds an annual family retreat in locations around Australia or New Zealand. But due to Covid, the last live retreat was cancelled despite much effort to organise it. This year it has been decided to put on a virtual retreat using Zoom from Thursday 6th January 2022 through Sunday 9th January 2022.

The scheduled events so far are:

- Thursday 6th January 2022: 'Question Time' by David Moffat either at 10AM or 8PM or both (TBD). [Click here to join Zoom at the time it begins](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/2074775351?pwd=ZEdFT0x1OTRVWFdOMzZqcEcrZ2dTdz09)
