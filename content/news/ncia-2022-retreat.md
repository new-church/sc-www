The [New Church In Australia (NCIA)](http://newchurch.net.au/) has been holding an annual family retreat in locations around Australia or New Zealand. But due to Covid, the last live retreat was cancelled despite much effort to organise it. This year it took a virtual form using Zoom in January.

Check out what goodies some presenters offered by using the links below.
