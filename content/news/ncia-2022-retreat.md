The [New Church In Australia (NCIA)](http://newchurch.net.au/) holds an annual family retreat in locations around Australia or New Zealand. But due to Covid, the last live retreat was cancelled despite much effort to organise it. This year it has been decided to put on a virtual retreat using Zoom between Thursday 6th January and Sunday 9th January 2022. Join presenters from around the world for this excellent opportunity to start a new year.

The following events are scheduled. For specific details, fliers, and Zoom links for each event please find the event [on the 'events' pages by clicking here](https://swedenborg.com.au/events/).
