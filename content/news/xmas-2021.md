The Swedenborg Centre will be closed over the Christmas and New Year break.

Our last open day is December 22nd, and our first day back will be January 6th, ready to start the online annual retreat that day (see events).

We have been delighted with your generous support over this difficult year, and hope you will continue to participate in - and benefit from - what we offer.

We wish you each a most wonderful and meaningful sacred season.

See you in the new year.

Thanks and greetings from the Swedenborg Centre staff, Liz Kemmis and Joe Vandermeer.
