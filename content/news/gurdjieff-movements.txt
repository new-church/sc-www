Did you ever see the film "Meetings With Remarkable Men"? 

Like Swedenborg, George Ivanovich Gurdjieff’s teachings focus on developing the quality of our inner being. Gurdjieff’s sacred dances and movements are a useful aid in this pursuit, as they enable our self-study and self-observation, provide personal challenges, and making possible this harmonious inner awakening and development. Precise movements, dances and postures are used which influence inner states, lead to an integration of breathing, thought, and habitual movement. 

Benefit from a greater sense of presence, awareness and attention. Gurdjieff used dance and art to transmit universal cosmic laws and enable our holistic integration and development through conscious effort. We invite you to experience the advantages for yourself by joining a movements class held on the first and third Saturday of each month between 3pm and 4:30pm in the hall under the Roseville New Church, 4 Shirley Road, Roseville NSW 2069.

Cost is normally around $10 per class.
