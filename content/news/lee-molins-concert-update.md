Unfortunately the shakuhachi and harp concert by Riley Lee and Cliona Molins at Roseville New Church on 25th July has had to be cancelled due to the extension of the Sydney Covid lockdown.

All those who have already bought tickets will be contacted with a refund.
We look forward to a post-lockdown opportunity to hear their calm and classic music again.
