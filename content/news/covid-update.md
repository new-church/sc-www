Government advice about the Covid lockdown in Sydney is allowing the Swedenborg Centre to re-open to visitors from Monday 11th October subject to NSW Public Health Order rules (regulations which are expected to be lifted from December 1st). So from Monday visitors are required to:
- provide proof of vaccination to enter
- sign in using the QR code
- wear masks indoors. 
The rules also require us to limit visitors based on the 4 square meter per person capacity, which allows the Centre to have 4 people per room (we have 2 rooms). Visitor numbers are expected to double on December 1st.

If you have any symptoms, or have been in contact with people who have Covid, or are otherwise feeling unwell, then please postpone your visit and get tested, and ask us to arrange an online conversation with you instead.

Meanwhile, all online Swedenborg Centre activites are continuing as usual, see events section (or "see all events") to check what's and check the event for details and use the Zoom link to join in once the event is live.

New information will be posted here as it becomes available.
