Government advice about the Covid lockdown in Sydney is allowing the Swedenborg Centre to re-open to visitors, subject to NSW Public Health Order rules (regulations which are expected to be lifted from December 1st).

So from Monday 11th October, visitors are allowed but are required to:
- provide proof of vaccination to enter
- sign in using the QR code
- wear masks indoors.

We are also required to limit visitors based on the 4 square meter per person capacity, which allows the Centre to have 4 people per room (we have 2 rooms). Visitor numbers are expected to double on December 1st.

Please, if you are experiencing any symptoms, or have been in contact with people who may have Covid, or are otherwise feeling unwell, then we ask you to postpone your visit and to get tested, and to phone or email us to arrange an online conversation instead.

All our online activites are continuing as usual - see the events section ("see all events") to check what's on, where you'll find event details and Zoom links to join in once each event starts.

New information will be posted here as it becomes available.
