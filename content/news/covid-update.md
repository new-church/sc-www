The Swedenborg Centre can now be a little more relaxed about visitors.

The following changes came through today from NSW Public Health:

With Covid restrictions easing as of 16th December 2021, we can all get back to doing the things we’ve missed. The new rules mean more freedoms for us all. Some of the key changes include:

We no longer require you to wear a mask at the Centre, though you’ll only need to wear a mask on public transport, planes and at airports, or if you work indoors in hospitality and aren’t fully vaccinated, however wearing a mask continues to be encouraged where you cannot socially distance and when indoors. Some businesses may continue requiring people to wear a mask as a condition of entry to protect the well-being of staff and customers.

Capacity limits have been lifted, so venues are open to everyone.

COVID Safe check-ins are only required for high-contact venues including hospitals, aged and disability care facilities, gyms, places of worship, funerals or memorial services, personal services (including hairdressers and beauty salons), pubs, small bars and registered clubs, nightclubs, and indoor music festivals with over 1,000 people.

Proof of vaccination is no longer required (is only needed for indoor music festivals with more than 1,000 people).

We will not need proof of vaccination (although there are some other businesses who still may continue to need their customers to be fully vaccinated and request to see proof of vaccination as a condition of entry to protect the well-being of staff and customers).

Thanks for supporting the Centre.
