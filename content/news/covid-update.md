The Swedenborg Centre is able to relaxed more about its visitors.

The following changes came through from NSW Public Health effective Thu 16th Dec 2021.

Covid restrictions have been eased. The key changes are:

We no longer require you to wear a mask at the Centre. You will still need to wear one on public transport, planes and at airports, or if you work indoors in hospitality and aren't fully vaccinated. Nevertheless, wearing a mask continues to be encouraged where you cannot socially distance and when indoors, and some businesses (other than the Centre) may continue requiring you to wear a mask as a condition of entry to protect the well-being of staff and customers.

Capacity limits have been lifted, so venues are now open to everyone.

Covid Safe check-in is no longer needed at the Centre. It is now only required for high-contact venues including hospitals, aged and disability care facilities, gyms, places of worship, funerals or memorial services, personal services such as hairdressers and beauty salons, pubs, small bars and registered clubs, nightclubs, and indoor music festivals with over 1,000 people.

Proof of vaccination is no longer required. It is only needed for indoor music festivals with more than 1,000 people. There are some other businesses (but not the Centre) who still may continue to need their customers to be fully vaccinated and request to see proof of vaccination as a condition of entry to protect the well-being of staff and customers.

Thanks for continuing to support the Centre. We look forward to your visit.
