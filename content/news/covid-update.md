Due to my (Joe's) recent close contact with several Covid-positive people, I have decided out of caution to socially isolate for a week. Meanwhile I will continue running all activities online - see the home page and events pages for any event changes.

Unfortunately, the door to the Swedenborg Centre will need to remain closed to visitors until Easter. I apologies for any inconvenience, but look forward to seeing you all online.

For links to join our Zoom events, please see the 'events' page [here](https://swedenborg.com.au/events/) and from there you can look through the events using the navigation at the bottom of each page.
