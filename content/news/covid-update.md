Covid lockdown in Sydney is currently in place until NSW reaches 70% vaccination rates (the government has not provided an exact date).

Meanwhile we are not on site to send out book orders, but will attend to them after end of lockdown.

All online Swedenborg Centre activites continue as usual, see events section (or "see all events") to check what's and check the event for details and use the Zoom link to join in once the event is live.

New information will be posted when the lockdown ends.
