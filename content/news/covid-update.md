The Swedenborg Centre is able to allow its visitors to be more relaxed, because the following easing of Covid rules was announced by NSW Public Health effective from Thu 16th Dec 2021.

To visit the Centre you do NOT need to:
- wear a mask
- worry about the number of people (capacity limits have been lifted)
- check-in (the Covid-Safe App check-in is no longer required)
- show proof of vaccination.

Thank you for continuing to support the Centre. We look forward to your next visit.
