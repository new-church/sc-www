The latest health rule updates in terms of visiting the Swedenborg Centre from 27th Dec 2021 require our visitors to:

- be limited to 8 (based on the capacity limit of 2 square meters per person, which does not mean you need to stay 2 meters apart from each other)
- check-in using the Covid-Safe App check-in

Proof of vaccination is no longer required.
And although you are welcome to wear a mask while visiting, we do not enforce this since often people are eatinbg and drinking coffee or tea while visiting (our coffee machine is back in action).

Thank you for continuing to support the Centre. We look forward to your next visit.
