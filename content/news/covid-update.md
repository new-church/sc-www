Due to my (Joe's) close recent contact with several Covid-positive people, as a precaution, I have decided to socially isolate for a week but will continuing to run all activities online. The door to the Swedenborg Centre will remain closed until Easter. Apologies for any inconvenience, but looking forward to seeing you online.
