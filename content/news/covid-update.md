The government advice about the Covid lockdown in Sydney will allow the Centre to re-open to visitors from Monday 11th October subject to the rules, restrictions and conditions issued by the NSW Government, which involves:
- check-in by QR code on entry using the Service NSW app on your phone
- wearing a mask
- limiting visitor number to comply with the 4 square meter per person limit, which allows the Centre to have 4 people in each room (we have 2 rooms) - capacity limit will double at some stage before the end of the year.

If you are feeling unwell, please postpone your visit and get tested and ask us to arrange an online conversation with you instead.

Meanwhile, all online Swedenborg Centre activites are continuing as usual, see events section (or "see all events") to check what's and check the event for details and use the Zoom link to join in once the event is live.

New information will be posted here as it becomes available.
