The Swedenborg Centre is currently closed for the Christmas and New Year break.

Our first day back will be January 3rd.

We have been delighted with your generous support in the past year, and hope you will continue to participate in - and benefit from - what we offer.

We wish you each a most wonderful and meaningful sacred season.

See you in the new year.

Thanks and greetings from the Swedenborg Centre staff, Liz Kemmis and Joe Vandermeer.
