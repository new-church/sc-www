The Swedenborg Centre will be closed for the Christmas and New Year break.

Our first day back will be Wednesday January 4th.

We have been delighted with your generous support in the past year, and hope you will continue to participate in - and benefit from - what we offer.

We wish you each a most wonderful and meaningful sacred season.

See you for our events in 2023.

Thanks and greetings from the Swedenborg Centre staff, Liz Kemmis and Joe Vandermeer.
