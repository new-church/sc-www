We are piloting a new event reading the spiritual work of the famous 13th century Persian poet Rumi.

The initial events will be for three weeks on Wednesdays at 7pm starting on 28th April, and thereafter depending on further interest.

Rumi's work is packed with spiritual instructions which resonate well with the works of Emanuel Swedenborg.

Sessions will be led by Tania Astans who will read it in Persian and in English, and will lead us in our exploration.
