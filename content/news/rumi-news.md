We have spent three weeks reading the spiritual work of the famous 13th century Persian poet Rumi from Wednesday 28th April.

Let us know if you have any feedback or any wish for more events like it using Rumi's poetic spiritual work.

Rumi's work is packed with spiritual instructions which resonate well with the works of Emanuel Swedenborg.

Sessions were led by Tania Astans who read it in Persian and then in English.
