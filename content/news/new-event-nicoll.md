British psychiatrist Dr Maurice Nicoll was a friend and close colleague of Carl Jung and was expected to be the successor to Jung in providing leadership to the emerging psychology profession. But this role was never fulfilled by Nicoll, because he gave up a lucrative Harley Street practice to study with P D Ouspensky who taught the Fourth Way of Gurdjieff. Nicoll was insightful in working with dreams, which was well suited to his growing interest in the writings of Swedenborg, especially as he matured in years and as a spiritual teacher, eventually making Swedenborg and the bible his primary reading sources. Nicoll demonstrated a deep understanding of the psychology of spiritual work, as can be seen in his notes written for students, collected in his "Psychological Commentaries on the teaching of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky." Nicoll's books "The Mark" and "The New Man" show a deep understanding and use of parables of the New Testament, and very much show his appreciation of Swedenborg.

In these reading sessions we will be exploring some of the material from "Commentaries...", helped by Swedenborg's writings and Fourth Way teachings. We will also mix it occasionally with sessions on other Nicoll works such as "The Mark" and "The New Man".

You will find a very informative page on Nicoll's interest in Swedenborg [here](https://swedenborg.com/scholars-the-swedenborgian-tree-gracing-maurice-nicolls-garden-of-esoterica/) which links to a Jeffrey Adams article based on his extensive and excellent research into Dr Nicoll's personal life and diaries.
