It has been decided to move the weekly Dr Groves reading and discussion events from noon Fridays to noon Thursday each week in 2026. We hope this will atttract additional participants. Apologies is this causes anyone an inconvenience, let us know if it does.

Looking forward to seeing more of you at these very rich reading and sharing sessions.
