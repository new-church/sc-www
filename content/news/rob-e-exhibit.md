Rob Evans (student of Dr Groves work) is setting up several art changing exhibitions at the Swedenborg Centre of previously unseen images from Michael Wright's art collection, thanks to Michael Wright's estate. The images are renewed periodcally, so even if you have looked before, we suggest you come again to see the latest new ones. You can view those art works at the Centre anytime in person. You might even be offered a free cuppa.
