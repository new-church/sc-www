On July 3rd, 2024 we received several copyright infringement notices for images we had inadvertently taken from the internet to enhance the presentation of our magazine Candela. The infringement notices were a surprise and shock. Isn't it okay to use images easily available on the internet, especially if you don't know who owns or made them, and especially if everyone seems to be doing the same thing, right? Isn't it good to make a Powerpoint presentation more interesting, colourful and entertaining to use that great image that says exactly what you want in pictures? Or to spruce up your free YouTube clips, right?

Well, actually, NO.

The way the law works is that the original creator of any piece of art legally owns all the copyrights to the art immediately without having to do a thing.

Creations - unless issued by the creator with a Creative Commons free public use licence - are automatically covered by the copyright act when they are created: pictures, music, etc, with the except - as far as I know - of AI-generated images, which are excluded. The artist does not have to apply for copyright to be added for a new work.

So unless:

- you are the original creator, or
- have obtained permission or a licence from the creator or appointed agent, or
- you come under the small number of "fair use" defences (see below), or
- are getting an image which has a Create Commons licence issued by the creator to it,

... then it would be better that you don't use that image off the internet. Start looking for - or creating - something else.

Creative people are entitled to deriving an income from their work.

I guess ingnorance and compacency have come from copyright not having been actively enforced very tenaciously, at least until now. Those times might be changing. Companies like PicRights are finding, checking and charging copyright user about their licences and pursuing infringers with fees. So beware. Even having done it in the past is no excuse to let it remain or to let it keep happening.

So you might ask, isn't a creative work in the public domain once it's on the internet? NO, "public domain" applies only to items which are no longer under copyright once it expires - which is many decades after it comes automatically in effect when the work was created and the clock starts counting the decades when the author dies. So don't wait around for that.

There are very few defences against infringement. "Fair use" in Australia mainly only allows for people to be let off the hook if a creatively something is licensed to the user, or is used for free for study purposes, or for reviewing the work, or to criticise or satire the work.

Our lessons have been:
Be careful (ignorance is no excuse, so when in doubt, don't!)
Be wise (be informed and live by that info)
Be kind (to the original content owners and their lives)
Be grateful (to the companies and lawyers who help us to check on our conscience and charitableness to others respecting their livelihood, rights and income).

Out of respect for these creators of the images we have enjoyed using in the past without obtaining their consent we have removed all past Candela from the web and changed the latest issue to have no images in them from the internet.

[https://picrights.com](picrights.com) - PicRights (and simlarly, Copyright Agent) are not law firms. They are third parties acting on behalf of rightsholders to identify and remedy the unlicensed use of those rightsholders' works online. Such rightsholders include Reuters, Alamay, Associated Press and Agence France Presse and others.

[https://www.bing.com/images/create?](bing.com/images/create?) - Bing image creator is one example of an easy to use AI picture generator. There are many other free or paid services out there like it, simply search the internet for them. Here's how easy it is, using the Bing link as an example. Click on the link to take you to Bing, and then type in normal English language the kind of image you want, e.g."racing cyclist with red helmet riding fast through rural countryside," which it generated in around 10 seconds. Or asking for "two men sitting at a computer screen talking to each other" also came back with four possible picture options within seconds. You can add whatever detail you like eg "not smiling" or "picket fence" or whatever you fancy to add.Plus you can name a style, eg "like Van Gogh" or "photorealistic" or "impressionist style". It really is that simple, and a bit of fun. You can keep going back to your request and add more detail to see what it comes up with next to improve the intended target idea. Then copy or download the image you want for your work. And those images are totally unique, and do not (won't yet, and hopefully never will) attract any copyright or infringements.
