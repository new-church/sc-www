On July 3rd, 2024 we received several copyright infringement notices for images we had inadvertently taken from the internet to enhance the presentation of our magazine Candela. The infringement notices were a surprise and shock. You may ask "isn't it okay to use images easily available on the internet, especially if you don't know who owns or made them, and especially if everyone seems to be doing the same thing?" Or wouldn't seem good to make my Powerpoint presentation more interesting, colourful and entertaining by using that great image that says exactly what I want in a picture? Or to spruce up your free YouTube clips that way? Etc...?

Well, actually, NO, it would not be good to grab any image. It would be good to be mindful of the following.

The way the law works is that the original creator of any piece of art legally owns all the copyrights to the art immediately without having to do a thing.

Creations such as artworks, photos, literature, dramatic, musical or other type of artistic work, unless the artist has specifically issued the work with a Creative Commons free public use licence, the work is otherwise automatically covered by the copyright act when they are created. Under Australian law, a work can only be protected by copyright if a human author contributed their independent intellectual effort, and since Aritificial Intelligence tools are by a machine and lack the definition of being a human author, therefore AI art - as one of the newest mediums for expression - is forbidden from copyright protection because it fails the human authorship requirement under current law. Despite several challenges to this, the Copyright Office holds fast that AI art lacks humanity and therefore does not currently have the legal status to own copyright. But whenever a human author creates a new work, the artist does not have to 'apply for anything to be protected by the copyright laws. It's automatic, by default, and it therefore becomes immediately enforceable by law. This applies whether the work is digital or not. That is something we all should know.

So, unless:

- you are the original creator, or
- have obtained permission or purchased a licence from the creator or appointed agent for its general or specific use, or
- you come under the small number of "fair use" defences (see below), or
- are getting an image which has a Create Commons licence issued by the creator to it,

... then it would be better that you don't use that image off the internet. Start looking for - or creating - something else.
Don't wait for an infringement notice to let you know what you can't use. Get informed (see useful links below).

Creative people are entitled to deriving an income from their work.

I guess ingnorance and compacency have come from copyright not appearing to be actively enforced much, at least not until now, except for famous and high value items. But visibility of images works both ways, and also lets managers of rights see what you've done with creative work and to match it against what else is out there. The times of assuming you can be lazy, or to get away with it, or not be noticed to do it, etc, might all be changing. Companies like PicRights are cleverly finding, matching, checking and charging copyright users about their licences or lack of one, and pursuing infringers with appropriate fees. So beware. Even having done it in the past is no excuse to let it remain longer or to let the practice keep happening.

So you might ask, isn't a creative work in the public domain once it's on the internet? NO, "public domain" applies only to items which are no longer under copyright once it expires. Copyright (even for anonymous or pseudonymous works) comes into effect from the moment a new work is created and lasts for 70 years after the death of the author of that work, regardless of whether the work was made public or not. So don't wait around for that.

There are very few defences against infringement. "Fair use" in Australia mainly only allows for people to be let off the hook if a creatively something is licensed to the user, or is used for free for study purposes, or for reviewing the work, or to criticise or satire the work.

Our recent lessons is learning to:
- Be careful (ignorance is no excuse, so when in doubt, don't!)
- Be wise (be informed, live by that info, be humble enough to address it if you get it wrong - apologise, make amends, take it down, replace it, do what is needed)
- Be kind (to the original content owners and their lives)
- Be grateful (thanks to the companies and lawyers who help us check on our conscience and charitableness to others respecting their livelihood, rights and income).

Out of respect for the creators of the images we have enjoyed using in the past but without seeking their consent or licences, we have removed from the latest issue of Candela, which is why there are no images in it anymore (except for Ruth's own photographs). And we have also removed all past Candela from the web and changed. For any related enquiries about Candela, etc, please contact the Swedenborg Centre.

[bing.com/images/create?](https://www.bing.com/images/create?) - Bing image creator is one example of an easy to use AI picture generator. There are many other free or paid services out there like it, simply search the internet for them. Here's how easy it is, using the Bing link as an example. Click on the link to take you to Bing, and then type in normal English language the kind of image you want, e.g."racing cyclist with red helmet riding fast through rural countryside," which it generated in around 10 seconds. Or asking for "two men sitting at a computer screen talking to each other" also came back with four possible picture options within seconds. You can add whatever detail you like eg "not smiling" or "picket fence" or whatever you fancy to add.Plus you can name a style, eg "like Van Gogh" or "photorealistic" or "impressionist style". It really is that simple, and a bit of fun. You can keep going back to your request and add more detail to see what it comes up with next to improve the intended target idea. Then copy or download the image you want for your work. And those images are totally unique, and do not (won't yet, and hopefully never will) attract any copyright or infringements.
