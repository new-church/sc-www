At 6:30pm on the first Monday of each month we will be screening a free spiritual movie at the Roseville New Church (4 Shirley Road, Roseville NSW).

Join us Popcorn, Jaffas, and Maltesers (sorry, the dentist said Fantales have been discontinued).
The movies will be titles based on a spiritual theme or by film-makers who were influenced by Emanuel Swedenborg's writings.
Such movies will include - for example - Ingmar Bergman movies, "What Dreams May Come," "As It Is In Heaven," and many more such titles.

Look forward to seeing you at these Roseville New Church first Monday of the month movie nights.

These movies are screened for free publically under our BSML screening licence.

1.	(May 5th) Seventh Seal (1957). Swedish black and white movie by Ingmar Bergman (already shown).
2.	(June 2nd) As It Is In Heaven (2004). Swedish movie about a music conductor who takes a mental health break in his childhood country town.

Amusing but insightful film, written, directed by, and starring Coline Serreau, which follows an alien woman visiting Paris from a heavenly green planet, shocked by humanity's neglect of nature. This film blends environmental themes with a sharp critique of consumerism.
6.	(October 6th) Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring, 2003. Korean movie directed by Kim Ki-duk about cycles of life, spiritual purification and karma. This film deals with spiritual evolution, and with nature as a correspondence of the soul's growth.

8.	(December 1st) It's a Wonderful Life, 1946. An enduring Christmas fantasy about an angel who saves a man's life, starring James Stewart as George Bailey.
