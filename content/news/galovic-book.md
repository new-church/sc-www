Our friend and iconographer Michael Galovic has recently launched his very latest work of art, a magnificent book containing a lifetime of his artistic works, a retrospective reflecting on his prolific creative output. The book has aptly been titled "Sailing Back to Byzantium" and it is indeed a work of art in itself. Michael's work ranges far beyond depictions of saints, but is a creative endeavour in itself. Being able to present such a mature retrospective of a life's work is a major milestone for an artist, and Michael certainly does the reflection justice. The book contains many important and interesting voices reflecting on his art, not just his own account.

While the book is only recently fresh off the press, it has already received high praise - see some recent acclamations of it [here](https://static.swedenborg.com.au/pdf/fliers/sbtb-twc-review.pdf) and [here](https://static.swedenborg.com.au/pdf/fliers/sbtb-review-rod-pattenden). The first review is from the editor of a deeply incisive and impressive text, The Catholic Weekly, and the other review is from the artist, art historian and theologian Rod Pattenden, founder of the online publication "Art/s and Theology" (he also contributed to Michael's book with his writing). Both are marvellous and highly informative as to what one can expect from the publication.

You can get a glimpse of the book in the short clip [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F0rVrwRBqA), and you can watch a good short documentary of Michael at his book launch discussing his work and his new book [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biY__qenZFE). As part of the launch one of Michael's work "The Resurrection" obtained a rightful place of honour in All Saints Church in Hunters Hill (Sydney), which you can view [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ5gkSoGVCk).

You can purchase the monograph from Michael either via his new website at [michaelgalovic.com](https://michaelgalovic.com) or by emailing him at [michaelgalovic@gmail.com](mailto:michaelgalovic@gmail.com) and he will express post you a copy wherever you are in Australia.

Michael's website above also contains (1) further material which may interest you about his work, (2) a place to purchase copies of his book and his works, (3) newsletters, (4) video clips documenting previous exhibitions such as the recent one on his work with St George and the Dragon. Enjoy!
