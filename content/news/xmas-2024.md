The Swedenborg Centre will be closed for the Christmas and New Year break. There will be no events during the closed period.

Our first day back will be Tuesday January 7th.

We have been delighted with your generous support in the past year, and hope you will continue to participate in - and benefit from - what we offer.

We wish you each a most wonderful and meaningful sacred season.

See you for our events in 2025.

Thanks and greetings from the Swedenborg Centre.
