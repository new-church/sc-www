A newly produced short video clip has been uploaded to the SwedenborgAustralia YouTube channel. This video explains the centrality of the need to be of use, the spiritual benefit of becoming a contributor rather than a consumer. You can view the video at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_d6-nUQJcY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_d6-nUQJcY)

Enjoy the presentation. We hope you find it useful. We strive to produce these material so that Swedenborg's writings can be presented without jargon, and we hope that they can be enjoyed and understood by a wide audience, so that the ideas might be applied to every viewer's life.
