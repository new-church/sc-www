The weekly Wednesday Swedenborg reading sessions are currently exploring some themes from Samuel Warren's Compendium and also reading from Rev George de Charm's excellent work on the proprium (i.e. our sense of self).

The twice monthly Swedenborg Saturday sessions often cover other religious wisdom traditions, such as the Hindu Advaita Vedanta tradition and Shin Buddhism, seeing how they all enrich Swedenborg's way of stating things. Seeing reality expressed from different perspectives is often very benefitial and enriching.

The weekly Friday Dr Groves reading sessions are currently studying his major book 'Spiritual Foundations', which covers all the essential components of a complete way of working on ourselves.

We hope you feel like joining some of these rich conversations. They are mostly a relaxed mixture of reading and spiritual reflection, or topical discussion and exploration of our own lives. We also have a lot of fun along the way.

See you soon.

Enjoy!
Joe
