The weekly Wednesday Swedenborg reading sessions has completed reading Rev George de Charm's excellent work on the proprium (i.e. our sense of self). We are now searching for our next topic, and may choose from (for example) temptations, the four key doctrines (life, faith, scriptures, the Lord), or we may select the teachings on charity/usefulness, or read Heaven and Hell. Join in and help us decide or contribute your favourite topic.

The twice monthly Swedenborg Saturday sessions often cover other religious wisdom traditions, such as the Hindu Advaita Vedanta tradition and Shin Buddhism, seeing how they all enrich Swedenborg's way of stating things. Seeing reality expressed from different perspectives is often very benefitial and enriching.

The weekly Friday Dr Philip Groves reading sessions are currently studying his major book 'Spiritual Foundations', which covers all the essential components of a complete way of working on ourselves.

We hope you feel like joining some of these rich conversations. They are mostly a relaxed mixture of reading and spiritual reflection, or topical discussion and exploration of our own lives. We also have a lot of fun along the way.

See you soon.

Enjoy!
Joe
