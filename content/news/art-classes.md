Thanks to the success of our pilot art classes, we are now offering more art classes, both live (in-person) and on Zoom.

Monthly session run from 10am to 3pm on the first Thursday of every month.

The subject of our art is 'correspondences'.

No booking required.

Art tuition is provided by Philip Ashton, former Principal of the Julian Ashton Art School. Correspondences material will be supplied by Joe Vandermeer.
