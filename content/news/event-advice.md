If events are not listed in the calendar, it is generally because something else if happening at the Centre or becuase staff are away, so assume that the event is not on if not listed. Apologies for any inconvenience caused by any inconsistency of regular events. We look forward to seeing you on the next occasion.

Feel free to check with us if you think the omission might be in error, which rarely but sometimes happens, but you will usually receive the above reason as a response (it's not on for any of a number of possible legitimate or unforseen reasons). Make the assumption that the online listing of events on this website is the most up to date and accurate indication of events and activities happening at the Centre.
