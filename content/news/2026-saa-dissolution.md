A Special General Meeting of the SAA will be held at 7pm on Friday 27th February 2026. You can attend via Zoom, and if you are a financial member you may vote by proxy.

The special resolution to be voted upon at this Special General Meeting is the motion:

"The members of the Swedenborg Association of Australia Incorporated resolve, pursuant to Article 45 of its Constitution and Section 62 of the Associations Incorporation Act 2009 (NSW),
1. To apply for the voluntary cancellation of the registration of the Association.
2. That any surplus assets which remain after the satisfaction of the association's debts and liabilities, will be transferred accordingly to the following non-profit organisation, registered as a charity, having objects similar to those of the Association: 100% of surplus funds will be transferred to the Swedenborg Centre (managed by the Sydney Society of the New Church, ABN 39 929 678 230). The donation is to be directed to the support of the outreach work of the Swedenborg Centre.
3. That members who have paid membership fees in advance for future years be given the option to receive a refund for the unused portion of those fees.
4. The committee is authorised to take all necessary administrative steps to effect this resolution."

We require 75% of the votes from those present (including proxies) to be in favour of this change for this special resolution to be accepted and implemented.
