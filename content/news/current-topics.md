The weekly Wednesday Swedenborg reading sessions are exploring Regeneration (Swedenborg excerpts edited by Lee Van Laer), which is proving to be very enjoyable and useful. After that we will most likely look at the four key teachings of Swedenborg (on life, on faith, on the scriptures, and on the Lord), and then will look at usefulness (charity), and read Heaven and Hell. Join in and help us decide or contribute your favourite topic.

The twice monthly Swedenborg Saturday sessions often cover other religious wisdom traditions, such as the Hindu Advaita Vedanta tradition, Shin Buddhism, and the Fourth Way of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky, seeing how they all enrich Swedenborg's way of stating things. Seeing reality expressed from different perspectives is often very benefitial and enriching.

Our twice monthly Dr Maurice Nicoll reading sessions are taking material from his "Psychological Commentaries on the work of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky" which has some wonderful psychological material distilled from Nicoll's understanding of the teachings of Gurdjieff, Ouspensky, Swedenborg, and Nicoll's friend and colleague Carl Jung.

The weekly Friday Dr Philip Groves reading sessions are currently studying his major book 'Spiritual Foundations', which covers all the essential components of a complete way of working on ourselves.

We hope you feel like joining some of these rich conversations. They are mostly a relaxed mixture of reading and spiritual reflection, or topical discussion and exploration of our own lives. We also have a lot of fun along the way.

See you soon.

Enjoy!
Joe
