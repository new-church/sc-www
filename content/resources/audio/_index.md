# Dr Philip Groves

Dr Philip W. Groves received PhDs in Biochemistry, Divinity and Psychology as well having specialised interests in the fields of Natural Medicine (diploma of Naturopathy), Chemistry, Marine Biology, Egyptology, Comparative Religion and Botany. He taught for over 40 years in universities, natural therapy colleges, and privately for his own groups of people until his passing into the spiritual world in 1999. The foundation of his teaching, whatever the topic, was always to guide people into the abundance of life, creative expression of life's potentials as well as developing greater knowledge and understanding of the world in which we live. These higher goals were explored by the use of practical application and real methodology founded in science, history, botany, Esoteric Christianity, Sufism and the works of Gurdjieff and Emanuel Swedenborg. Dr Groves taught in a relaxed manner, demonstrating at all times his love for the world and the Work; a search for truth, wisdom, love and good, and belief that maintaining these aspects of life must become part of our understanding and fill our everyday life.

# Dr Michael Stanley

Dr Michael Stanley was Principal of the New Church College, a Swedenborgian theological seminary in Manchester, England. With a doctorate in Physics, his career moved from research in solid state physics to philosophy, psychology, and religion and particularly to the spiritual symbolism of the Bible as set forth by Swedenborg. Dr. Stanley has particular interest in the synthesising potential of the New Age, and of the power of Swedenborg's teachings in focusing this synthesis toward spiritual renewal.

# Emanuel Swedenborg

In a time of spiritual upheaval Swedenborg sought to understand the deeper nature of spiritual realities. He first tried by exploring the outer world through the sciences, but as his search deepened he was drawn into exploring his own nature. Eventually a door was openened to him revealing not only the true nature of his own spirit but also the entire spiritual reality across all worlds in great detail, which he continued to experience, explore and document daily for around three decades. The clarity, consistency and wholistic account as well as the unprecedented detail is priceless for any spiritual searcher. In this small book he draws together in the simplest form and language possible all the great themes of his spiritual search and experience, which makes it an excellent starting point and summary.
