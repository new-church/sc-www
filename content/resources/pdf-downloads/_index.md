Rev Doug Taylor, during his pastorate at the Hurstville Society of the New Church, emphasized outreach through radio broadcasting, with his interest in mass media dating back to a TV appearance in 1961. He produced his first weekly Australian 15 minute radio programs in 1966, and a second series ran from 1968 until 1974. To listen to some of these early broadcasts, visit [here](https://tinyurl.com/2wbptecx). By the time Doug left Sydney he had delivered 323 broadcasts based on 150 scripts, which led to the establishment of study groups. Funding for these broadcasts was at first from Bryn Athyn but later funds came from a legacy from Dr William Moore, which supported the promotion of the New Church teachings. After Rev Taylor's departure, Rev Bernard Willmott and later Rev Ian Arnold continued the radio outreach, with Ian producing more than 130 broadcasts on Sydney radio station 2KY. This program, reaching an estimated 10,000 listeners, eventually shifted to 2SER in 1981. Ian, along with Neville Jarvis, co-presented the program into the 1980s. The surviving scripts are available below. Ian Arnold also served as Principal of The New Church College in Manchester, Britain, and Principal of the Australian New Church College until 2009, and as Pastor to the Brisbane Society of the New Church from 2002 until his retirement.
