Radio stations 2KY and later 2SER broadcast programs to introduce Sydney's radio listeners to various topics about Swedenborg and his writings. These well-written scripts were designed to introduce the general public to these powerful spiritual ideas. Broadcasting of The Swedenborg Program first begun in the 1970's by Rev Douglas Taylor and Rev Bernard Willmott, and continued into the 1980s by Rev Ian Arnold and Neville Jarvis. Transcripts below are by Ian Arnold, who served as Principal of The New Church College in Manchester, Britain, then as Principal of the Australian New Church College until 2009. Ian was Pastor in Brisbane from 2002 until his retirement. We hope you enjoy this material.
